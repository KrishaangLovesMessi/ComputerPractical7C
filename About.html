    <h1>⇒In India, many kids, teenagers, adults etc want to learn programming but there is not much availability, and if there is, then it is on youtube which many people don't know about.
        They go and get scammed by well-known companies who just waste your precious time and money, and after taking the money from you they teach your child block-based programming whereas they should be learning real programming(text-based programming). So to solve all those issues our team decided to make this website which redirects you to the right people so that you can become one of the right people.
